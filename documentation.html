<h1>API documentation for Web Client Developers</h1>


<section>An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. In the context of a web client application, a front-end developer would use the API to send requests to the server and receive responses, without having to concern themselves with the implementation details of the server.

To use the API in a web client application, the front-end developer would need to know the endpoint URL(s) to send requests to and the structure of the requests and responses. They would also need to have any necessary authentication credentials, such as an API key. The developer would use this information to send requests to the server and handle the responses in order to display the appropriate data to the user.

For example, a front-end developer might use JavaScript to send an HTTP GET request to an endpoint on the server to retrieve a list of products, and then use the response to dynamically populate a list on the web page.

The front-end developer do not need to know about the use of backend technologies such as node.js or SQL that might be used to implement the server.

<section>
    <p>Our API provides a set of endpoints for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. The following sections will provide an overview of the available endpoints, the HTTP methods and parameters that can be used, and the expected response formats.
    </p>

<h4>Create:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Endpoint URI: /api/resources</li>
<li>HTTP Method: POST</li>
<li>Parameters: Name, Description (sent in the request body in JSON format)</li>
<li>HTTP Response Codes: 201 (Created), 400 (Bad Request), 500 (Internal Server Error), syntax error</li>
<li>Response Format: JSON</li>
</ul>

<h5>Example:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Request: POST /api/resources</li>
<li>Request Body: {"Name":"Resource1","Description":"This is a test resource"}</li>
<li>Response: 201 Created</li>
    
</ul>


<h4>Read:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Endpoint URI: /api/resources/{id}</li>
<li>HTTP Method: GET</li>
<li>Parameters: id (sent as a path parameter)</li>
<li>HTTP Response Codes: 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error), syntax error</li>
<li>Response Format: JSON</li>
</ul>

<h5>Example:</h5>
<li>Request: GET /api/resources/1</li>
<li>Response: 200 OK</li>
<li>Response Body: {"id":1,"Name":"Resource1","Description":"This is a test resource"}</li>


<h4>Update:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Endpoint URI: /api/resources/{id}</li>
<li>HTTP Method: PUT</li>
<li>Parameters: id (sent as a path parameter), Name, Description (sent in the request body in JSON format)</li>
<li>HTTP Response Codes: 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error), syntax error</li>
<li>Response Format: JSON</li>
</ul>
    
<h5>Example:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Request: PUT /api/resources/1</li>
<li>Request Body: {"Name":"Resource2","Description":"This is an updated resource"}</li>
<li>Response: 200 OK</li>
</ul>

<h4>Delete:</h4>
<ul><li>Endpoint URI: /api/resources/{id}</li>
<li>HTTP Method: DELETE</li>
<li>Parameters: id (sent as a path parameter)</li>
<li>HTTP Response Codes: 204 (No Content), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error), syntax error</li>
</ul>


<h5>Example:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Request: DELETE /api/resources/1</li>
<li>Response: 204 No Content</li>
</ul>
    
<p>Please note that all requests and responses sent to and from the API should be in JSON format. Also, the API requires that the client sends a valid API key in the headers of each request.
